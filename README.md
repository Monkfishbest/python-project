# Food Takeaway

Youâ€™ve been tasked with making an order management system for a takeaway. This takeaway takes orders over the phone and enters them into the system for the kitchen to cook them and to keep track of them. 

## MVP

You should be able to create an `Customer` with a name, phone number, address, and a list of `Order`s.

A `Customer` should be able to place several `Order`s and an `Order` should contain a list of `Item`s (an item should have a name and a price).

There should be a page where you can see all `Customer`s and be able to click through to each `Customer` to see the details of their `Orders` and where you should be able to edit or delete the `Order`. You should be able to edit and delete `Customer`s

## Extensions:

- Be able to order multiples of an item
- Be able to add up total for an order
- Be able to set an order as dispatched and delivered
